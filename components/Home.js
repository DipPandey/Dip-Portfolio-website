                    My journey in the field of technology began with a deep-rooted passion for video editing, which eventually blossomed into a fascination with creating seamless and engaging digital experiences. In 2019, I took a significant leap and moved to Tasmania, Australia from Nepal to pursue a degree in Information Technology at the University of Tasmania (UTAS). This transition was both challenging and rewarding, as I navigated a new country on my own while immersing myself in rigorous academic studies. During my time at UTAS, I honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development, cultivating a strong foundation in software engineering. Driven by a desire to solve real-world problems through technology, I have worked on numerous projects that blend creativity with functionality. As I continue to expand my expertise, my aspiration is to become a full-stack engineer, always eager to learn and innovate. Whether it's developing intuitive user interfaces or robust server-side solutions, I am committed to leveraging my skills to create impactful and efficient digital solutions.
