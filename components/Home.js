                Hey there! I'm Dip Pandey, a Software Engineer with a degree in BICT from the University of Tasmania. My journey began with a passion for video editing, which sparked my fascination with creating beautiful front-end experiences and seamless back-end functionality. When I'm not coding, you'll find me either making music, hiking, being a family guy, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
